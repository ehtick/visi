## User perspective

For VISI application users, VISI functions as an inbox or taskmanager,
displaying which messages require responses, what responses are
anticipated, and agreed-upon deadlines.

### Execution

-   How do you know your message has arrived?

-   How do you know that the right person has received the message?

-   How do you know that an authorised person wrote the message?
