# Conceptual

## User perspective

For VISI application users, VISI functions as an inbox or taskmanager,
displaying which messages require responses, what responses are
anticipated, and agreed-upon deadlines.

### Execution

**Send messages and keep appointments**\

1.  **VISI focuses on fulfilling agreements.**\
    Users can easily identify their required actions and initiate
    message flows for specific transactions if they have the correct
    role. They can also view response options and anticipate incoming
    messages.

2.  **It is clear whether a message has arrived.**\
    Due to the agreed-upon message traffic protocol, users can confirm
    message delivery.

3.  **Transferring work to a new employee is seamless.**\
    Because an employee has a role, a successor can be appointed during
    a collaboration. From that moment on, this successor takes over the
    message flow. It is expected of a VISI application that the
    successor also has the messages of the predecessor available.

4.  **The communication can be found, without mutual dependence.**\
    If several organisations work together, they can each use their own
    VISI software. Due to the implemented message traffic protocol, two
    people in different organisations each have access to the
    information within their own organisation and the message traffic at
    the intersection of the other organisation in their own VISI
    software.

5.  **With VISI, changes in the collaboration agreements are always
    traceable.**\
    During the project, the agreements about the workflow, message
    content, roles and responsibilities can be changed.

### Preparation

**Flexibility of VISI in making collaboration agreements**

1.  **Agreeing on tasks and responsibilities in advance clarifies
    expectations.** During collaboration preparation, roles and tasks
    are agreed upon.

2.  **Agreeing on communication flows in advance allows you to
    anticipate responses and decisions.** During the preparation of a
    collaboration, it is important to determine the roles of each team
    member and their communication channels. This includes deciding on
    the message flow and the type of information that is expected from
    each other. By setting agreements and expectations beforehand,
    everyone involved is aware of their responsibilities and can work
    more effectively. Moreover, it is essential to decide on the content
    of each message, including any attachments that need to be shared.
    This ensures that the messages are clear, concise, and relevant to
    the collaboration.

3.  **Parties have the freedom to shape the cooperation as desired.**
    VISI is very flexible: The parties have the freedom to structure the
    collaboration as is suitable for their project. VISI standardises
    the way in which you digitally record roles, workflows and messages.
    This requires software packages to be prepared to be able to read
    and activate these flexible agreements per project or collaboration
    so that VISI-based communication can be started.

## VISI structures

In order to allow the exchange of information to take place in a
structured manner, digital communication agreements have been
established within VISI. The ease of use is comparable to, for example,
sending e-mails or offering documents on a shared SharePoint
environment. The difference is that the contents of the messages are
predefined. For example, a message contains editable fields such as a
form. The sender can add attachments to the messages. At the end of a
project, it is still clear which version of an attachment/file has been
approved and which ones have been denied.\
\
It is also considered in advance who communicates with each other based
on which responsibility. This is expressed in so-called roles.\
\
Workflows take place between those roles to achieve a certain result.
For this we use the term 'transaction'. We record all of this in a model
called the VISI framework. During the implementation phase, project
participants can focus on communication content rather than contract
agreements.

-   Be sure that you are in the right place at the right time correct
    process.

-   Immediately see what information is available (who already said
    something)

-   Immediately see what information is needed and how it is done
    process continues

-   Immediately see how much time you have to respond

-   Know that you are the right person participates in the process

-   Certainty that everything is done with the right mandate handled
    with digital signature

-   Certainty that everything is secured for the future in accordance
    with archive law
