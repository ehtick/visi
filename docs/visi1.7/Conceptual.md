## User perspective

For VISI application users, VISI functions as an inbox or taskmanager,
displaying which messages require responses, what responses are
anticipated, and agreed-upon deadlines.

### Execution

**Send messages and keep appointments**\

1.  **VISI focuses on fulfilling agreements.**\
    Users can easily identify their required actions and initiate
    message flows for specific transactions if they have the correct
    role. They can also view response options and anticipate incoming
    messages.

2.  **It is clear whether a message has arrived.**\
    Due to the agreed-upon message traffic protocol, users can confirm
    message delivery.

3.  **Transferring work to a new employee is seamless.**\
    Because an employee has a role, a successor can be appointed during
    a collaboration. From that moment on, this successor takes over the
    message flow. It is expected of a VISI application that the
    successor also has the messages of the predecessor available.

4.  **The communication can be found, without mutual dependence.**\
    If several organisations work together, they can each use their own
    VISI software. Due to the implemented message traffic protocol, two
    people in different organisations each have access to the
    information within their own organisation and the message traffic at
    the intersection of the other organisation in their own VISI
    software.

5.  **With VISI, changes in the collaboration agreements are always
    traceable.**\
    During the project, the agreements about the workflow, message
    content, roles and responsibilities can be changed.
