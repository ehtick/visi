### Management structure VISI Open Standard TC130607-02

**Introduction**\
In recent years, the VISI Standard has developed into a mature,
operational Open Standard. This includes a demand-driven approach for
further development, management and maintenance. This approach has been
introduced since 2009 in accordance with the BOMOS model. CROW is the
administrator of the VISI Standard and monitors this approach on behalf
of the sector. As administrator, CROW also organizes the updating of the
VISI Standard. The VISI Technical Committee (VISI TC) plays an important
substantive role in this. The content of (the scope of each new release
of) the Standard is determined by the sector representation.\
\
**Role of the Technical Committee**\
The VISI TC contributes to the construction-wide development of the VISI
system and ensures the connection of the VISI system to user wishes. The
TC consists of experts who participate in the committee free of charge
(namely: VISI-certified software suppliers, VISI advisors, and a
representative/liaison from the User Group). The committee is chaired by
CROW. This facilitates the committee and supplements it with a
representative of the independent testing body (TNO) that operates on
behalf of CROW.\
\
The tasks of the TC are not sector-related and consist of:

-   Technical development, documentation (requirements, guidelines) and
    implementation of user wishes in the VISI Standard

-   Technical advice on development and management of the VISI Standard.

The standard will be formally published by CROW after adoption by the
sector representation (i.e. the VISI Steering Committee).\
\
The output of the TC consists of technical adjustments/improvements to
the Open Standard (VISI system, requirements and/or guidelines;
normative or informative) that are implemented by the Software suppliers
in their VISI-compatible software. After (a new release of) this
Standard has been implemented in the software, it is tested by CROW and
'certified' after a successful test. TNO is the independent testing body
commissioned by CROW. The costs of the test are borne by the relevant
software supplier [^1].\
\
**Release Policy**\
Users can continuously express wishes and needs. CROW collects the
points for improvement and bundles them. Improvements to the Open
Standard are implemented in new releases. At the request of VISI users
and VISI suppliers, CROW uses an annual release cycle, where the scope
is flexible, but the deadlines are strictly observed (this will be
elaborated further below). In this way, expectations are well managed.\
\
The scope of each new release is determined based on the input from VISI
Users, Advisors and Suppliers. The User Group channels the wishes and
needs of users, which are ultimately bundled and submitted to CROW.
Users are involved in consultations. The User Group consists of
representatives of organizations that apply the VISI Standard with
conviction, operates on a non-sector basis, and ensures the exchange of
knowledge between the various users of the VISI Standard.\
\
\
The collection of improvement points is prioritized for each release,
from which the scope of the new release follows. The TC members assign a
priority to each improvement point for each release. The resulting
'average value' determines the priority that the TC applies to each
improvement point. In this way, the points for improvement are given the
best possible balanced order according to importance. Depending on the
feasibility, this results in the subset of improvement points that forms
the scope of the release. This subset is developed by the TC into a new
version of the VISI Standard (after consultation with the Users).\
The sector representation (the VISI Steering Committee) ultimately
determines the scope of each new release. Improvement points that cannot
be included in the new release can, depending on the priority, already
be considered by the TC for inclusion in a subsequent release.\
\
**Process**\

The creation of a new Version of the VISI Standard takes place in the
following steps:

1.  CROW collects and registers improvement points from Users, Software
    Suppliers and Advisors. Points for improvement can be reported
    directly to CROW.

2.  The User Committee channels the wishes and needs of the users
    wherever possible.

3.  In consultation with the TC, CROW compiles a subset of the reported
    improvement points. This subset is prioritized in such a way that
    there is a distinction in importance between all improvement points
    in the subset. In addition, the complexity of all points is also
    determined.

4.  The Technical Committee is technically developing the subset into a
    new version of the VISI Standard. This also includes the complete
    and unambiguous technical documentation for the VISI Guidelines.

5.  The Technical Committee categorizes this list and examines whether
    the points fit within the knowledge and expertise of the committee,
    and/or need to be split into smaller points for improvement. If
    necessary - if there really is no other option, for example because
    feasibility is at stake - the TC can re-prioritize the improvement
    points. The Technical Committee provides explicit feedback to CROW
    of the final work list with points for improvement.

6.  The Technical Committee addresses the improvement points of the
    prioritized subset one by one in order of the established priority.
    An improvement point is only completed if the documentation of the
    VISI Standard has been completely updated, including complete
    technical documentation in the Guidelines (exp, xsd), and an
    associated test scenario.

7.  The progress of the Technical Committee is transparent to the Users.

8.  After six months, the Technical Committee bundles the completed
    improvement points into Release Candidate 1 (RC1).

9.  CROW links the contents of RC1 back to the Users.

10. After one year, the Technical Committee bundles all completed
    improvement points into Release Candidate 2 (RC2).

11. CROW links the content of RC2 back to the Users.

12. The sector representation determines the scope of RC2 as the scope
    of the new Release. CROW provides feedback on the content of this
    formal Version to the Users and publishes the formal version in the
    VISI Guidelines.

13. The Software Suppliers will implement the full RC2 within six months
    and must also successfully pass the inspection by the testing
    authority within this period. The findings when implementing the
    improvement points are fed back to the Technical Committee by the
    Software Suppliers on a point-by-point basis.

14. The Technical Committee discusses the findings in the context of the
    next release(s).

The principle of 'time-boxing' applies to the above process (see figures
1 and 2). There are fixed delivery dates that occur annually.

\
\
All areas for improvement are worked on in a central, publicly
accessible work environment. The following is recorded for each
improvement point: (unique) ID number, name, description, priority,
status, date of first report, by whom reported, planned version, and a
brief description of the solution. Comments can be made for each
improvement point and attachments can be administered. The complete
solution is unambiguously technically documented in the VISI
Guidelines.\
\
The work environment provides insight into the points for improvement,
functional and technical documentation (including guidelines), and
source files (exp, xsd) for each Version.\
\
Finally, it is important that the testing scenario is adjusted if
necessary, so that the VISI-compatible software can also be tested for
the implemented improvement points.\

### Backwards compatibility

Backwards compatibility relates to the functionality/operation of the
VISI Standard (and/or frameworks according to this standard)\
\
**Definition**\

The \"backwards compatibility\" of a new VISI Standard means that the
operation of the new VISI Standard (and/or a framework according to this
standard) has at least the same operation as the previous version of the
VISI Standard (and/or a framework according to this standard). framework
according to this standard).\
With others, if functionality is lost, or if behavior is changed, there
is no backwards compatibility.\
\
A new VISI Standard (and/or a framework according to this standard) does
not have to be backwards compatible. This is a choice, a deliberate
choice.\
\
**Process**\

For each improvement point, the topic of \"backwards compatibility\" is
included and it is analyzed whether the technical solution has an impact
on the backwards compatibility of the VISI Standard.\
It is not a prerequisite that a technical solution must necessarily be
backwards compatible.
