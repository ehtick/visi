## VISI Basics

When partners work together (for example in a project), clear mutual
communication is an essential condition for smooth progress. VISI
provides tools for making communication agreements.\
\
The basic principles of VISI are based on the DEMO method developed by
prof. dr. ir. J.L.G. Dietz of the TU Delft *see "Introductie tot DEMO",
1996, Dietz, J.L.G., Samson, Alphen aan den Rijn; ISBN 9789014053271*.
Many VISI concepts are derived from this method.\
\
Communication agreements are laid down in a structure called a
'framework'. The following section describes the components of the VISI
framework. Each part of the framework is explained.

### VISI Framework

In accordance with the VISI system, communication agreements are laid
down in a structure called the 'VISI framework'. The terms used in VISI
frameworks follow the VISI jargon for clarity. Important terms in the
VISI system are:

-   Role

-   Transaction

-   Interaction map

-   Transaction scheme

-   Transaction State

-   Message

-   Data Element

-   Appendix

The building process can be represented as a network of interrelated
roles between which transactions take place. The schematic
representation of this network, in fact the 'framework', is also
referred to as the 'interaction map' [^1]. Here in section 1.2.3. delved
deeper into. It turns out to be possible to distinguish a pattern of
transactions that can be applied to all construction projects in a
certain application area. In this way, a specific VISI framework can be
created for each application. There are some standard frameworks that
can be used as a starting point, such as UAV, UAVgc, management &
maintenance. Standard frameworks can also be created for other processes
(the number of possible frameworks is in fact unlimited). These generic
frameworks can be tailored to a specific project.

### Role

In the VISI system, responsibilities and tasks are not assigned to
*officials* within parties, but to *roles*. This was done because
although the same roles always occur in construction projects, officials
can often fulfill several roles or switch roles. The cooperation concept
or contract form has *no* influence on the existence of the roles. The
cooperation concept *does* influence the assignment of roles to parties;
the *role division*. Parties can, for example, fulfill the role of
'initiator', 'client', 'builder' or 'designer'.\
\
There is by no means always a one-to-one relationship between parties
and roles. There are construction projects in which one party takes on
more than one role, and there are also construction projects in which
several parties have the same role. Examples include a municipality that
is both the initiator and the client, or a contractor for earthworks and
an installation company that both take on the role of builder in a
project. The same party can also fulfil different roles within different
construction projects.\
\
Tasks and responsibilities can thus be divided on the basis of the
division of roles between the parties. Examples of roles are
'commissioning' and 'building'. This then refers to the party that has
the specific task of, in this case, 'commissioning' or 'building'.\
\

#### Summary

-   Within construction projects the same roles always occur.

-   The cooperation concept and the contract form influence the
    distribution of roles among the parties.

-   A party can fulfill different roles in a construction project.

-   Different parties can have the same role in a construction project.

-   A party can take on different roles within different construction
    projects.

-   Roles are referred to in terms of 'commissioning', 'building' and
    'designing'.

-   Roles are assigned responsibilities and authorities.

### Transaction

When two parties agree that work must be done, or that something else
must be done, there is a \"transaction\". Each transaction has an
initiator (the role that initiates the transaction) and an executor (the
role that executes the transaction). Figure 2 shows a transaction. The
arrow always runs from the initiator to the executor.\
\![Figure 2. There are always two roles involved in a transaction: never
more, never
less\]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-leidraad/bijpenpen/1-doelen-thorough principles-concept framework /images/fig-2-transaction-roles.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-leidraad/bijpenpen/1-doelen-thorough principles-concept framework /images/fig-2-transaction-roles.png){.uri})

An example is the situation in which a municipality asks an engineering
firm to design a viaduct. The municipality fulfills the role of
commissioning party and is the initiator of the transaction; after all,
she initiates the transaction. The engineering firm takes on the role of
designer; it executes the transaction, and is thus an executor.\
\
A transaction goes through a life cycle. The status of a transaction,
say how far the transaction has progressed, is indicated by transaction
states. Ideally, transactions are initiated, requested, promised,
executed, completed, and accepted in sequence.\
\
Within a transaction, messages are included that are necessary to handle
formal communication between roles. For example, messages have been
developed to give orders, report changes or deviations, report progress
and send ready notifications.

#### Summary

-   A transaction is a business agreement between two roles.

-   The role that initiates a transaction is called an initiator.

-   The role that executes a transaction is called executor.

-   Transactions go through a number of transaction states during
    settlement.

### Interaction Map

A (VISI) interaction map is the schematic representation of a framework.
It is intended to map the relevant roles and transactions for an
existing process. As mentioned, VISI distinguishes between roles that
initiate a transaction (initiator) and roles that execute a transaction
(executor). A transaction has only one initiator and one executor.

\
The added value of a transaction map is that it focuses on the
interfaces between roles. The details of the interactions between those
roles are not yet discussed. That will come later. The often complex
processes within a role are also not considered. By using 'abstract'
roles, the transaction map can be applied to all construction projects,
regardless of the collaboration concept or contract form. It is a
valuable tool to analyse and define the essential elements of the
production process.\
\
An interaction map contains all transactions that are necessary for the
acting roles in that project to make their contributions to the process.
All roles and transactions on the card have a unique identity and name.
The numbering is arbitrary. The name of a role is derived from the main
activity that the role performs in the process. The interactions can be
summarised in a table. The example in figure 4 looks like this:

::: {#tab:my_label}
  **Transaction Type**        **Transaction Result**
  --------------------------- ----------------------------------
  T1 Deliver design           Design has been delivered
  T2 Deliver specifications   Specification has been delivered
  T3 Deliver 3D model         3D model is delivered
  T4 Provide Cost Estimate    Cost Estimate has been delivered
:::

#### Summary

-   The interaction map visualises the building process as a network of
    related roles and transactions.

-   The distribution of roles is influenced by the construction phase,
    the collaboration concept and the contract type.

-   Parties can fulfill more than one role.

-   Roles can initiate several transactions.

-   Roles of a certain type can appear more than once.

### Transaction scheme

Transactions are handled by roles sending each other messages. A
transaction contains a set of messages that are exchanged for a specific
reason. The transaction also leaves undisputed which roles participate
(and who is initiator or executor), at which point of the life cycle
communication takes place and -- if applicable -- in which order the
messages should be sent. The list of messages that can be sent as part
of a transaction is called a transaction schedule. The transaction
schedule naturally contains the name, description and desired outcome of
the transaction.\
\
As an example of a transaction schedule (in UML notation), figure 5
deals with the request for a 3D model. The transaction can only be
initiated by role R1 with the message 'Request for 3D model'. The 3D
engineer (role R3) can reply with the message 'Work done and request for
approval'. After the message 'Work approved' or 'Work not approved' the
transaction is completed.

\![Figure 5. Transaction schema
example\]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-leidraad/annexen/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-5-transactionschema.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-leidraad/annexen/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-5-transactionschema.png){.uri}
)

Figure 5. Example of a transaction schedule\
\
The order of messages is such that, as far as possible, related messages
are placed in a logical order. For example, before a confirmation of the
order can be sent, an order must first have been issued.\
\
The settlement of transactions takes place according to a fixed pattern
and has six different states. Certain messages can put the transaction
in a different state. Arrows indicate in which direction the message is
going (from initiator to executor role or vice versa).\
\
The schemes for the different transactions are widely applicable: the
messages usually cover a fair share of the communication required
between roles. However, the parties have the freedom to adjust
transactions (and therefore transaction schedules) to their specific
needs by mutual agreement. More about this in the section 'messages'.

#### Summary

-   Transaction schedules list the name, a description and the result of
    a transaction.

-   Transaction schedules contain the messages that can be sent.

-   In transaction schedules, the messages are grouped by message
    category.

-   The effect on the transaction status is indicated for each message.

-   For each message it is stated who sends the message and who receives
    it (a message can go both ways).

-   Messages have a logical order.

-   Parties can decide in mutual consultation to enter into transactions
    (and transaction schedules). to fit.

### Transaction State

The settlement of a transaction takes place by means of messages and
according to a fixed pattern. Six states are distinguished in the
settlement of most transactions:

-   Start

-   Requested

-   Promised/Execution

-   Change/Hold

-   Declare/Ready

-   Accept/End

A transaction enters 'start' when an initiator assigns a transaction to
an executor. This was of course preceded by a (negotiation) process. The
initiator sends the executor an instruction (1) requesting the status of
the transaction. With the sending of an order confirmation (2) by the
executor, the status changes to 'promised / execution'. Within 'promised
/ execution', various messages (3) are available for, for example,
reporting changes and deviations, delivering progress reports, as well
as requests for and feedback from quality tests (figure 6).

\![Figure 6. The different transaction
states\]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-guideline/attachments/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-6-transactionstates.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-guideline/attachments/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-6-transactionstates.png){.uri})
Figure 6. The different transaction states

With the notification of order changes (by the initiator) or deviations
and consequences (by the executor), the transaction status changes to
'change / hold' (4). When the initiator has reported a change, the
executor can respond by reporting the consequences of the order change
(5). The initiator can reject this (6) or approve it with an additional
command (7) which is then confirmed by the executor (2). In either case,
the transaction will return to the 'promised/executed' state.\
\
With a ready report (8), the executor indicates that the order has been
completed and the transaction ends up in the 'report ready' state. After
acceptance by the initiator (9), the transaction enters the 'accepted /
finished' state and the transaction is completed.

#### Summary

-   Transactions have six different transaction states.

-   By sending a message, a transaction can move from one state to
    another.

### Message

A transaction consists of messages that are necessary to handle the
formal communication between the roles. A message is in fact a completed
'form' with data, where the data in the fields of the form is stored in
a database. A framework specifies for each message which data elements
it contains. A message is of a specific message type and is inextricably
linked to a transaction (although a message type can be associated with
several transaction types).\
\
A message contains the data structure prescribed in the VISI framework.
The message has a \"header\" that includes details of the involved
roles, the transaction, and the work to which the transaction relates.
The body of the message contains the information to be transferred
consisting of completed data elements, attached documents and references
to documents. Attachments with data can be linked to a message. The
content of a message (or attachment) can contribute to the BIM of a
project.\
\
By working with VISI, this information transfer is brought into the
(formal) process context.

schedule\]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-guideline/attachments/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-7- message preview.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bimloket/visi/visi-guideline/attachments/1-objectives-ground principles-concepts-framework/images/fig-7- message preview.png){.uri})
Figure 7. Example of a message from a transaction schedule

#### Summary

-   Messages are used to handle transactions.

-   Messages have a logical order.

-   Messages consist of data elements.

-   Attachments can be added to a message.

### Data Element

Each message consists of a number of data elements. A data element has
an identifier, a name and a description. Conditions can be set for the
format and value of the data element. Examples of data elements are
Transaction Description, Message Description, Sender Name, Sender
Organisation, Sender Role Description, Recipient Name, Recipient
Organisation, Recipient Role Description, Transaction Start Date,
Message Send Date, and Message Read Date.\
\
There can be two types of data elements in a VISI framework. First, the
"simple data elements." Elements of this type form the basis. In
addition, there are the \"complex data elements\" that are used to group
data elements, for example the data of a contact person.\
\
For example, the complex data element \"Contact\" could consist of the
following simple data elements:

-   Initials

-   First Name

-   Middle Name

-   Last Name

-   Mobile Phone

-   etc.

Although VISI was born out of a need for standardisation, it is possible
to omit or add data elements to messages. After all, the communication
needs can differ per project. The starting point is that the parties
determine in mutual consultation which data will be exchanged, based on
the templates provided in VISI.

#### Summary

-   Messages are made up of data elements.

-   VISI distinguishes between simple and complex data elements.

-   Parties are free to add or subtract data elements from messages.

### Appendices of VISI-messages

Attachments can be linked to VISI messages. This is very similar to an
'attachment' to an e-mail. An important difference is that an attachment
of a VISI message is provided with a specification. This is done by
entering a number of data elements. In addition, VISI messages are
archived with their attachments, so that they can always be found.\
\
VISI messages are an important tool for transferring documents and
files. The type of message and the content of a message determines why
the document is transferred from one to another (meaning in the
process). The specification of the attachments is important for document
management.\
\
There are frameworks in which multiple attachments ('AppendixTypes') are
created for different types of attachments. Because there can be many
types, and the user should not be burdened with the choice of the
correct AppendixType, it is possible to indicate in a framework when
which AppendixType may be selected.

[^1]: The notation of the VISI interaction map is based on Prof. Dietz
    model. The notation differs from the Business Process Modelling
    Notation (BPMN, a standard for process modelling), on the one hand
    to keep interaction maps as simple as possible and, on the other
    hand, because the concept of 'transaction' is not defined within
    BPMN. The latter is a common, but not an official Open Standard.
