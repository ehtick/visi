Furthermore, all communication (if it takes place over the internet)
between a VISI user and a VISI application must use HTTPS with the same
specifications. Other security measures can be taken at the
infrastructure level if desired. VISI communication via the internet may
not be possible without an SSL security certificate, both for
communication between SOAP servers and for communication between user
and VISI web application.
