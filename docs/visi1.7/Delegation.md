## Delegation and mandating

Delegation and mandate are concepts about the division and allocation of
powers that are regulated by law and are therefore legally defined
concepts. In addition, mandate is also used in non-legal speech. Such as
'How far does his mandate extend to enter into financial obligations in
the context of project\
\
Delegation is defined as: the transfer by an administrative body of its
power to make decisions to another person who exercises this power under
his or her own responsibility (Article 10:13 General Administrative Law
Act). Delegation means that the delegate will exercise the authority in
his own name. The transfer of authority goes so far that the originally
competent party loses its authority (Article 10:17 General
Administrative Law Act).\
\
A mandate is defined as: the authority to make decisions on behalf of an
administrative body (Article 10:1 General Administrative Law Act).
Unlike delegation, the authority remains with the grantor of authority
(or: mandans). In addition, Article 10:2 of the General Administrative
Law Act stipulates that the mandate recipient (or: representative) makes
decisions on behalf of the mandate provider. The mandate provider
therefore remains responsible and legally accountable for the decisions
taken. The decision is deemed to be a decision as if it had been taken
by the administrative body itself.\
\
DEMO only talks about responsibility and not about which official is
vested with that responsibility. If responsibility for (the execution
of) a transaction involves delegation, only the person to whom the
authority has been delegated becomes the executor of that transaction.
If the responsibility (for the execution of) a transaction involves a
mandate, both the person who grants the mandate and the person who
receives the mandate become executors of the transaction in question.
When mandating, it must therefore be chosen per instance of the
transaction who will fulfill the executor role.\
\
In the case of non-legal mandates, the limit of the mandate must be
indicated in the transaction. For transactions with a mandate, at least
1 executor with a full mandate must be appointed and 0 to n executors
with a limited mandate may be appointed.\
\
VISI works with PersoonInRol, a person is given the mandate to start
(initiate) or carry out (execute) a specific transaction on behalf of a
specific organization. VISI does not have a limited mandate. VISI does
have authorized representatives, who can initiate or execute
transactions on behalf of the person (in a role in an organization) with
his or her mandate. The mandate holder remains responsible for the
actions of his representative(s).\
\
VISI has successors (substituting), these are people who can take over a
role from a person in an organization. The original initiator and
executor remain intact in these transactions, but another person can
complete these transactions.\
\
It is proposed to apply the use of authorized representatives and
successors as known in VISI in this trailer.
