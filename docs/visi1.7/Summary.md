# Summary

VISI is the open standard for organising digital communication about
your collaboration. People make agreements in advance when one
communicates which message with each other, while working together they
exchange the agreed messages. If several organisations work together,
they can each use their own VISI certified software. Message exchange
between software vendors is guaranteed. In this way, each party can, in
its own software, fully understand mutual communication. A
characteristic of VISI is its flexibility: both the workflow and the
message content, can be set up specifically for each organisation,
project or collaboration. In the event of a dispute, it is immediately
clear how the cooperation has expired. VISI provides an audit trail,
because agreements are digitally recorded in messages.
